1. <b>How do I use this website?</b>

<br /><br />
You can use this site in two ways. If you do not have an account, or are not logged in, you can search for already generated test problems and download them.
If you have an account and are logged in, you have permission to run the generators and create new test problems with the parameters that you specify.

<br /><br />
2. <b>What is a test problem? A generator? A collection?</b>

<br /><br />
A test problem is a sparse matrix, sometimes with a right-hand side and solution vector. The TxTPS machine stores previously generated test problems and you can create new ones.

<br /><br />
3. <b>My test problem generation took almost no time. What happened?</b>

<br /><br />
Someone has already generated the problem with your parameters, so the server gave you those results.

<br /><br />
4. <b>My test problem generation takes very long. What's happening?</b>

<br /><br />
A generator run can take minutes to complete. You will get a message in email when your problem has been generated. This message is the definitive answer: the server tries to update the web page on which you submitted the problem, but this may sometimes fail.

<br /><br />
5. <b>The web page with the result contains a strange message / no files to download.</b>

<br /><br />
Sometimes a generator will fail. Sorry. We try to give an informative message, but that is not always possible. Use the contact form if you really want to know.

<br /><br />
6. <b>What sort of hardware does TxTPS run on?</b>
<br /><br />
The server has two Intel 8-core Sandybridge CPUs and a bunch of RAID-ed drives.
